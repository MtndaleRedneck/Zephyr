/**
 * Serves the original movie file (no re-encode) to the Zephyr Player over plain HTTP.
 *
 * URL shape: http://<wifi-ip>:<port>/s/<sessionToken>/<id>[/sub/<n>]
 *  - Session token is random per serving session and dies with it; the pairing
 *    token is never used here (libVLC can't set custom headers, so the token
 *    rides in the path).
 *  - Range requests get proper 206 + Content-Range so libVLC can seek.
 *  - SAF content URIs are served directly via openFileDescriptor; if a provider
 *    hands back a non-seekable (pipe) descriptor we fall back to copying the file
 *    into the cache once and serving that.
 *  - Binds to the Wi-Fi interface only.
 *
 * Prototype status: platform-verification list still open (SAF seekability across
 * providers, service type, Wi-Fi lock behavior). Nothing here is final.
