     *  [final] untouched. [expectedBytes] (evaluated AFTER the copy) is the
     *  provider's declared length: a POSITIVE declaration is validated BEFORE
     *  [commit] runs - a short stream is never committed (complete-or-nothing
     *  covers content, not just rename atomicity). Zero/negative declarations
     *  are not known lengths (streamed-content providers commonly report 0):
     *  like an absent declaration, EOF is then the only completeness signal
     *  (declared limit). A clean EOF BEYOND a stale positive declaration is
     *  accepted and reported via [onStaleDeclared] - never unlimited, since
     *  [maxBytes] and the free-space floor already capped the copy. [commit]
     *  owns the final rename so the caller can arbitrate commit against
     *  request abandonment atomically (default: plain renameTo). */
