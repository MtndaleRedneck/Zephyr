/**
 * Pure-JVM decision core for the stream auto-stop (teardown C1, settled):
 * the SAME 5-minute rule covers the Zephyr AND the VLC target - the watchdog
 * polls whichever player the stream was actually handed to.
 *
 *  - an open connection is always life (a long pause holds its socket);
 *  - after the first served stream, stops only on 5 continuous idle ticks
 *    with the target player in Stopped/Ended; playing, paused, unknown and
 *    unreachable all cancel (settled: unknown/unreachable NEVER stops);
 *  - a service that NEVER served anything (a failed handoff, a PC that never
 *    connected) still took the wake and Wi-Fi locks: with no open connection
 *    it stops after 5 ticks (~5 min) so the locks are released (lifecycle L2).
 *    That is the phone's own state - nothing was ever served - not a guess
 *    about the PC, so it is separate from the settled unknown/unreachable rule.
